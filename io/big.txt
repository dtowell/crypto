Today we live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured 
by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, 
political groups... So I ask, in my writing, What is real? Because 
unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudo-realities manufactured by very 
sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms. I 
do not distrust their motives; I distrust their power. They have a lot 
of it. And it is an astonishing power: that of creating whole universes, 
universes of the mind. I ought to know. I do the same thing.”
                     ― Philip K. Dick
